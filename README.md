# QuickLink
> Small project just for an attempt of implementing a next.js Link for vanilla websites.

# Why use this
If you just want your anchor elements to be a tiny bit more *modern* in your static and simple website,
this can be a great option since the script itself is very simple. Actually, it's so simple that you should
take a look at it by the way! Just so that you can understand what it actually does.

# How to Use
To use it in your website, simply add a script tag importing it at the head of your html files:
```html
<head>
    <script src="link.js" type="module"/>
</head>
```
Simple as that!
